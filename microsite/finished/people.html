			<h4>Tapas Seven</h4>
			<p class="text">The McCanns were on holiday with seven friends; the families had eight children in all, including the McCanns' three. The nine adults dined together most evenings at 20:30 in the resort's tapas restaurant, thus the media dubbed the friends the "Tapas Seven".</p>
