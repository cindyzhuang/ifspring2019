    		<h3>Day of Disappearance</h3>

    		<p><strong>The McCanns arrived on Saturday, 28 April 2007, for their seven-night spring break in Praia da Luz.</strong><br><br> At 20:30 the parents left to dine with their friends in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas restaurant. Madeleine's mother had intended to check on the children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door. He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left without checking to make sure they were in there. Kate made her own check of 5A at around 22:00. She entered the apartment and noticed that the children's bedroom door was wide open. When she tried to close the door, it slammed shut as though there was a draught, which is when she saw that the bedroom window and its shutter were open. Madeleine's Cuddle Cat and pink blanket were still on the bed, but Madeleine was gone. After briefly searching the apartment, Kate ran back towards the restaurant, screaming....</p>
