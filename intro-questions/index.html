	<li>I'm very much interested in design, but lack the skills of creating digitally, which is a very important skill in my field of interest. I do designs for clubs, but would like to learn more about coding and web development so I can take on more projects and expand my experience. </li>

	<li>I do not have experience with HTML/CSS/JS.</li>
	<li>I hope to master html to the extent that I could comfortably transfer my designs from paper to screen.</li>
	<li>Designing for screen requires a completely different language to be learned, but there are so many more options for designs. Paper and pen has its limits but for web design, there are so many other accessories that come into play, such as links, animations, videos, etc.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.cap-hpi.com/">Cap-Hpi</a> shows effective design because there is a prominent color scheme that interacts well with the other information on the page and does not obscure the message by using conflicting visuals. The design is very simple, but makes good use of the white space and uses structured visuals to increase conversions and advance the company's mission. </li>
	<li><a href="https://www.jillkonrath.com/">Jill Konrath</a> shows effective communication because the website is fairly easy to navigate, which allows the viewers more fast and efficient access. When visitors arrive at the website, they are quickly able to figure out the purpose of the website and what is offered. Also, the website makes it clear how visitors can connect with Jill Konrath, either through social media or filling out a form through the website.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/?ref=logo">Facebook</a> is a website that works well because it showcases one of the most uniques property of a good website: personalization. Every visitor is unique, not everyone has the same purpose or responds in the same way as others, and Facebook does a good job of personalizing each user's experience based on their background and interests.</li>
