<h1>Feedback for Jeong Min</h1>

<strong>Pic 1: </strong>

<ul>

<strong>Desktop:</strong><br><br>

<li>I don't know if the black border at the top and bottom is necessary since the background of your picture is mostly black, so you could prob put your quote there. </li><br>

<li>Maybe change the font, times new roman doesn't really go with the quote. </li><br>

<li>The style of your quote doesn't match what it's saying. The quote seems urgent/serious, but the way you styled it makes it seem kind of too relaxed. </li><br>

<strong>Mobile: </strong><br><br>

<li>Maybe don't cut off the alien's head/eye, try cropping more on the other side of the picture and make its face completely present. </li><br>

<li>The dimensions seem a bit off. </li><br>

</ul>

<strong>Pic 2 (Yoda): </strong><br>

<ul><strong>Desktop: </strong><br><br>

<li>There is so much space on either side of yoda, maybe put the text there? Otherwise the text to image ratio seems to off and it kinda makes it look empty. </li><br>

<strong>Mobile:</strong><br><br>

<li>Again, try not to cut Yoda's ear off.</li></ul>

<strong>Pic 3 (Star Wars):</strong>

<ul><strong>Desktop:</strong><br><br>

<li>Maybe add a gradient at the bottom? The white text kind of is hard to read against the man's light shirt. </li><br>

<li>Make the text bigger to even out the ratio of text and image. Maybe even consider putting the quote and the speaker on different lines to create better spacing and give it more shape.</li><br>

<strong>Mobile: </strong><br><br>

<li>Make text bigger, try putting speaker and quote on separate lines.</li></ul>
