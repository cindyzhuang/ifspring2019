<p align="center"><em>[Verse 1]</em><br><br>
	You look so wonderful in your dress<br>
I love your hair like that<br>
The way it falls on the side of your neck<br>
Down your shoulders and back<br>
We are surrounded by all of these lies<br>
And people who talk too much<br>
You've got that kind of look in your eyes<br>
As if no one knows anything but us<br>

<br><i>[Pre-Chorus]</i><br><br>
And should this be the last thing I see<br>
I want you to know it's enough for me<br>
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need<br>

<br><i>[Chorus]</i>
<p class="chorus">
I'm so in <span>love</span>, so in <span>love</span><br>
So in <span>love</span>, so in <span>love</span><br></p>

<p class="verse"><i>[Verse 2]</i><br><br>
You look so beautiful in this light<br>
Your silhouette over me<br>
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes<br>
Is the Tenerife sea<br>
And all of the voices surrounding us here<br>
They just fade out when you take a breath<br>
Just say the word and I will disappear<br>
Into the wilderness<br>

<br><i>[Pre-Chorus]</i><br><br>
And should this be the last thing I see<br>
I want you to know it's enough for me<br>
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need<br>

<i><br>[Chorus]</i><br></p>
<p class="chorus">I'm so in <span>love</span>, so in <span>love</span><br>
So in <span>love</span>, so in <span>love</span><br></p>

<p class="verse"><i>[Bridge]</i></p>
<p class="bridge">Lumiere, darling<br>
Lumiere over me<br><br>
Lumiere, darling<br>
Lumiere over me<br><br>
Lumiere, darling<br>
Lumiere over me</p>

<p class="verse"><i>[Pre-Chorus]</i><br><br>
And should this be the last thing I see<br>
I want you to know it's enough for me<br>
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need<br>

<br><i>[Chorus]</i><br></p>
<p class="chorus">I'm so in <span>love</span>, so in <span>love</span><br>
So in <span>love</span>, so in <span>love</span><br></p>

<p class="verse"><i>[Outro]</i><br><br>
You look so wonderful in your dress<br>
I loved your hair like that<br>
And in the moment I knew you, Beth</p>
